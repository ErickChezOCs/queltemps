# Queltemps
Following Angular Projects

This app is a PWA weather app build with angular and hosted on firebase.

We are using Angular service workers, HTTP client, Material components.

Hosting URL: https://queltemps-aa65e.web.app

We didn't try rebuilding from this repo and we removed the environments directory

holding the APIkeys(for dev and prod), it's a bad practice to have any keys in github repo.

Having that in mind the app can be build and hosted as we did.




This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.
